EVEMU-DESCRIBE(1)
=================

NAME
----

     evemu-describe, evemu-record  - print information and events from an
     input device

SYNOPSIS
--------
     evemu-describe [/dev/input/eventX] [output file]

     evemu-record [--autorestart=s] [/dev/input/eventX] [output file]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
evemu-describe gathers information about the input device and prints it to
stdout. This information can be parsed by evemu-device(1) to create a
virtual input device with the same properties.

evemu-record captures events from the input device and prints them to
stdout. The events can be parsed by evemu-play(1) to let a virtual input
device created with evemu-device(1) emit the exact same event sequence.

evemu-describe and evemu-record need to be able to read from the device; in
most cases this means they must be run as root.

If an event node is provided, evemu-describe and evemu-record use that event
node. Otherwise, the user must interactively choose from a list of detected
devices.

If no output file is given, stdout is used.

OPTIONS
-------

  --autorestart=<s>
	Terminate the current recording after <s> seconds of device
	inactivity. This option requires an output, the file is suffixed
	with the date and time of the recording's start.
	The timeout must be greater than 0.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
If evemu-record does not see any events even though the device is being
used, the device may be grabbed by a process (EVIOCGRAB).  This is usually
the case when debugging a synaptics or wacom device from within X. VT
switching to a TTY or shutting down the X server terminates this grab and
the devices can be recorded. For most X drivers, disabling the device also
removes the grab.

The following command shows the processes with an open file descriptor on
the device.

   fuser -v /dev/input/eventX
