evemu - Kernel device emulation

To build, you need to have the autoconf and libtool packages
installed. Then, do

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make

To extract the properties of a device at /dev/input/eventX, do

   sudo ./tools/evemu-describe /dev/input/eventX > device.properties

To record a stream of events, do

   sudo ./tools/evemu-record /dev/input/eventX > device.data

To create a device from the properties, do

   sudo ./tools/evemu-device device.properties

To replay a stream of events, do

   sudo ./tools/evemu-play /dev/input/eventY < device.data

To destroy the device, do

   sudo ./tools/evemu-destroy /dev/input/eventY

To record a stream of events in xml format, do
    sudo ./tools/evdev-record-xml /dev/input/eventX evdev-events.xml
Note: the file format used by evdev-record-xml to record events is not
compatible with evemu-play. To replay a stream of events, record using
evemu-record instead.

To install evemu, do

   sudo make install

By default, evemu installs to /usr/local. To change, use the --prefix
configure option.

Enjoy,
Henrik
